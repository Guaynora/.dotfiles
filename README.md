## Checkhealth
Make sure you call ``:checkhealth`` to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Quickstart
This configuration is based on using ``Stow`` to automatically create symlinks.

This repository is designed to be cloned at home ej ``/home/user/.dotfiles`` then run ``stow nvim`` and so for each folder
